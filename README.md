# Web3Waves
A web3 website that interacts with a solidity smart contract deployed on the Rinkeby testnet

Smart contract was built with solidity and JS, deployed to the Rinkeby testnet at the included address. Website was built on replit with React. 

This project serves as a brief primer to deploying and interacting with smart contracts - upon connecting their wallet (in which there exist funds on Rinkeby) the client can "wave" to the contract with a message and the smart contract keeps track of all prior "waves". Additionally, the client is randomly (~50-50) chosen to win eth everytime they wave/
